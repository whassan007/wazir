# Wazir Release Notes - v0.1.59

**Release**: `v0.1.59`  
**Theme**: Heterogeneous Fleet Execution, Durable Recovery, and Production Cross-Platform Release Validation

---

## Highlights

### 1. Heterogeneous Fleet Execution Across 6 Platform Pairs
- Validated distributed controller-to-worker dispatch and streaming execution across all cross-platform permutations:
  - macOS controller -> Linux worker (including ARM64 DGX Spark)
  - Windows controller -> Linux worker
  - Linux controller -> Windows worker
  - macOS controller -> Windows worker
  - Windows controller -> macOS worker
  - Linux controller -> macOS worker
- Full token-authenticated SSE streaming, remote cancellation, and outcome collection.

### 2. Linux ARM64 NVIDIA DGX Spark Support
- Hardware discovery engine hardened for ARM64 Cortex-X925/A725 CPUs without traditional `/proc/cpuinfo` `model name` fields using `lscpu`.
- Deep integration for the NVIDIA GB10 Blackwell GPU with Address Translation Services (ATS), GPU Chip-to-Chip (C2C) interconnect, and 122 GB host-GPU unified memory.

### 3. Resource-Aware Heterogeneous Scheduling
- OS platform and CPU architecture affinity (+1.5 OS match, +1.0 architecture match).
- CUDA accelerator routing (+2.0 for NVIDIA CUDA capability match, +0.5 for unified memory).
- Hard rejection of incompatible workloads (preventing CUDA tasks from routing to non-CUDA machines or macOS tasks to Windows machines).

### 4. Durable Recovery and Split-Brain Fencing
- WAL-backed durable task dispatch and claim leases with unique cryptographically random tokens.
- Fencing of stale / expired leases (`LEASE_LOST`), strictly preventing duplicate execution side effects.
- Automatic orphan sweep and safe re-dispatch when workers crash or disconnect.

### 5. Automated Release Validation Gate
- `scripts/release-gate.mjs` provides strict validation across all 8 capability categories: Installation, Build, CLI, Agents, Persistence, TUI, Fleet, and Recovery.
- Multi-platform matrix reporting with strict no-false-PASS semantics.
