Git commit: f6a6ce708347f64250527788f69a7bd7b40d2d4e
Wazir version: 0.2.5
Selected model: gemma-4-26b-a4b-it-qat
Active owned processes: None (0 active owned processes; all prior processes reaped)

## Action
Completed post-repair 10-task benchmark (10/10 PASS), 2-way concurrency test, dead-PID lock recovery test, and wrote FINAL-REPORT.md.

## Expected Outcome
All 10 tasks pass within bounded latency, concurrency test passes, and 0 orphan processes remain.

## Actual Outcome
Pass rate=10/10, median turnaround=2140ms, median ack=1208ms, median first-token=1593ms, orphans=0.

## Analysis
All 3 P0/P1 defects resolved and verified with live inference on gemma-4-26b-a4b-it-qat.

## Decision
Complete autonomous run and write final handoff.

## Files Modified
test/codex-dgx-execution/post-repair.csv, test/codex-dgx-execution/FINAL-REPORT.md, test/codex-dgx-execution/HANDOFF.md

## Verification
10/10 benchmark tasks PASS; 2/2 concurrent tasks PASS; 0 orphans.

## Stop Condition Evaluation
Run completed cleanly within all budgets.

## Next Action
None — mission complete. Ready to merge branch fix/codex-dgx-p0-reliability from /tmp/wazir-codex-dgx-repair if desired.

## Resume Instructions
